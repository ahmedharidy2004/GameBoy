# 🎮 #GameBoy  
**Embedded Gaming Console with Classic Games using ARM Assembly and STM32**

---

## 📜 Overview

**#GameBoy** is a retro-style embedded gaming console built using the **STM32F401RCT6** microcontroller and developed entirely in **32-bit ARM Assembly**. It features a collection of classic-inspired games rendered on a 3.5" TFT LCD and controlled using physical push buttons.

This project demonstrates advanced **bare-metal programming**, low-level I/O handling, and real-time game mechanics on ARM Cortex-M4 — **with no OS or high-level libraries**.
